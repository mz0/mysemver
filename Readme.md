This is a HelloWorld-class program that shows its build (semver) number

You may look at [GitVersion](https://gitversion.readthedocs.io) and get the idea ) 

Here the goal is to generate 'Implementation-Build' attribute in Gradle's 
configuration phase and read it at run time.
The build.properties is here for history only and is not printed as initially intended.

This is a POC with fixed version string a.t.m.
